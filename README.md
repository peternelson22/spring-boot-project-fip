## Spring Boot App

This is an application that can be used by employees to
track work progress and for the management to monitor and manage details
its employees.  
In this era of remote work, this app can be of immense benefit to 
both employers and employees.   
I intend it to be use by large companies to manage their employees especially remote employees.

To access the endpoints available as of now, I have used Swagger3

Simply get the project into your local machine and access exposed
endpoints via http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.
